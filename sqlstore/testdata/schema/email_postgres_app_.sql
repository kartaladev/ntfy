-- PostgreSQL schema for ntfy's optional email delivery records.
--
-- A host that emails notifications applies this document in addition to the
-- notification store's own; a host that does not never needs it.
--
-- One row per notification that a dispatcher has considered. There is no
-- foreign key to the notifications table: retention deletes notifications in
-- batches on every dialect, and the dispatcher removes the records it leaves
-- behind.
--
-- Identifier columns are pinned to the C collation, as in the notification
-- store's schema.

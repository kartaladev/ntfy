-- SQLite schema for ntfy's optional email delivery records, 3.35 or later.
--
-- A host that emails notifications applies this document in addition to the
-- notification store's own; a host that does not never needs it.
--
-- One row per notification that a dispatcher has considered. There is no
-- foreign key to the notifications table: SQLite enforces foreign keys only
-- behind a per-connection pragma, and the dispatcher removes the records
-- retention leaves behind.
--
-- Instants are TEXT in the one fixed encoding the notification store uses.

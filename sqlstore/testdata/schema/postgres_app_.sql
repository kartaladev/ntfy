-- PostgreSQL schema for the ntfy notification store.
--
-- Identifier columns are pinned to the C collation. The default collation
-- already compares case-sensitively; C is for ordering. A locale-aware
-- collation can sort 'a-b' before 'ab', and notification identifiers contain
-- hyphens, which would make keyset paging skip or repeat rows. C is byte order,
-- which is the order the identifiers were minted in.
--
-- links and data are text, not jsonb. jsonb reorders object keys and rewrites
-- number literals, and the store promises to return a publisher's payload
-- exactly as it was published.
--
-- Table and index names carry the host's configured prefix, applied when this
-- document is rendered; with no prefix configured they are exactly as written.
